# Tetris

This project is a small Tetris clone that is designed to run in a browser.

It has been implemented entirely by AI/LLM tooling as a coding challenge at work as part of an effort to get more familiar with these technologies.

The primary rule for the challenge was to not write any code, and instead have the tooling generate all of the code for you by providing it with specifications and directions on what to do. The challenge ran for a 24h period.

## Notes

- The `PROJECT_PRINCIPLES.md` file includes all of the high-level project management directions for the tooling.
- The `PROJECT_SPEC.md` file contains all of the details about how the game should work and function. Much of this follows the [Tetris Spec](https://tetris.wiki/Tetris_Guideline).
- The `TECHNICAL_PLAN.md` documents the technical direction and tools used by the project.
- The `TODO.md` file is summary of all the tasks that were generated by the AI tools, and the `stories/` subdirectory contains details about each story and how it should be implemented.
