# Tetris

This project is a small Tetris clone that is designed to run in a browser.

It has been implemented entirely by AI/LLM tooling as a coding challenge at work as part of an effort to get more familiar with these technologies.

The primary rule for the challenge was to not write any code, and instead have the tooling generate all of the code for you by providing it with specifications and directions on what to do. The challenge ran for a 24h period.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18 or higher recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run Development Server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the development server. The game should open automatically in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`.

3. **Build for Production**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This creates an optimized production build in the `dist/` directory that can be deployed to any static file server.

4. **Preview Production Build**

   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

   After building, you can preview the production build locally.

## Deployment

The production build outputs static files to the `dist/` directory that can be deployed to any static file hosting service.

### Browser Compatibility

- Chrome/Edge (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Requires modern ES6+ support and Canvas API

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Source code for the game
  - `game/` - Phaser game code
    - `scenes/` - Game scenes (Boot, Preloader, MainMenu, Game, GameOver)
  - `App.tsx` - Main React component
  - `PhaserGame.tsx` - React wrapper for Phaser
- `public/` - Static assets (images, styles)
- `vite/` - Vite configuration files

## Development Workflow

- Changes to source files will hot-reload automatically in development mode
- ESLint is configured for code quality checks
- TypeScript provides type safety

## Notes

- The `PROJECT_PRINCIPLES.md` file includes all of the high-level project management directions for the tooling.
- The `PROJECT_SPEC.md` file contains all of the details about how the game should work and function. Much of this follows the [Tetris Spec](https://tetris.wiki/Tetris_Guideline).
- The `TECHNICAL_PLAN.md` documents the technical direction and tools used by the project.
- The `TODO.md` file is summary of all the tasks that were generated by the AI tools, and the `stories/` subdirectory contains details about each story and how it should be implemented.

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Phaser 3
- **UI Library**: React 19
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Package Manager**: npm
